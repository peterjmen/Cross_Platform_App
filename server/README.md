# Server

This is the server for the cross-platform web application. It is built using [Express](https://expressjs.com/) and uses [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as its database.

In development mode, the server uses an in-memory MongoDB database. In production mode, the server uses a cloud MongoDB database.
